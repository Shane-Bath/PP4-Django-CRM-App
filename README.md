## CRM Django App - Clientflow
This is a customer management system for a small business.
This Django app is not designed for mobile devices. It is designed for use in an office on standard size screens only.

### Features
-   You can create a client file
-   Log client details, addresses, phone number and email
-   You can edit clients details
-   Create, edit and delete notes for each client
-   View the list of your clients
-   Log phone call
-   Edit and delete calls
-   Create a task 
-   Delete tasks

## Design
This app was first layed out in Balsamiq. It is has Dashboard from which you navigate to the other apps. 

There is User registration and authentication, 
A User registration form is used with fields like username, email, and password. With User login and logout functionality. I have used AllAuth for this functionality. 

Once the user is registered, they can access the dashboard. From there they can create new clients, make nots on each client. Log calls and keep a task list. 

The Dashboard is the central hub. 

## Testing 
I have manually navigated through different pages and functionalities. I have Verified that all elements (buttons, forms, links) are functioning as expected, and the user interface is rendering correctly.
